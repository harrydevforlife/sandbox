        "1. **Data Generation (`generate_sample_data`)**:\n",
        "   - Creates a pandas DataFrame with random numerical data. You can adjust the number of rows and columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Writing Functions**:\n",
        "   - **`write_csv_pyarrow`**: Converts the pandas DataFrame to a PyArrow Table and writes it as a CSV file.\n",
        "   - **`write_csv_writer`**: Uses Python's `csv.writer` to manually write rows to a CSV file.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Benchmarking Function (`benchmark_write`)**:\n",
        "   - Measures execution time for a specific write function.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Run Benchmark (`run_benchmark`)**:\n",
        "   - Runs the write operations multiple times and computes the average execution time for each method.\n",
        "   - Uses `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` to manage temporary file paths.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Main Function (`main`)**:\n",
        "   - Defines parameters (number of rows, columns, and runs) and starts the benchmark.\n",
        "   - Displays average execution times for both methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Running the Benchmark**\n",

        "1. **Save the Script**: Save the above script to a file, e.g., `csv_benchmark.py`.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- **`pyarrow`**: Optimized for high performance, especially on large datasets. It uses C++ backend and multi-threading for faster execution.\n",
        "- **`csv.writer`**: Simpler but slower, as it processes rows in Python without additional optimizations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Customizations**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dataset Size**: Adjust `NUM_ROWS` and `NUM_COLS` to simulate larger or smaller datasets.\n",
        "- **Number of Runs**: Modify `NUM_RUNS` for more robust averages.\n",
        "- **Compression**: Experiment with additional settings like compression when applicable for PyArrow.\n",
